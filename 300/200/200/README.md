Sync GitLab and DevRev so issue status is always real-time and driven by code.

## Overview

Connect GitLab with DevRev, and ensure your work stays in sync between the two systems, such that issues and statuses are always real-time and driven by code activity. GitLab for DevRev is a snap-in that has been used by several organizations, and ties DevRev issues closely with Git activities, eliminating the need for humans to manage issues.

Why should you un-manage your work? You should use this snap-in if you want to reduce work about work. Let machines manage issues, including creating and updating statuses, so developers can focus on work that matters. You’ll resonate with this, if you have ever:

- Delivered a hot-patch and realized you never had an issue to track it
- Wasted time just updating your team on the status of an issue
- Or just felt that creating and managing issues is a distraction

If your team’s best practice is to link your GitLab activity to an existing issue-ID during branch creation, commits and MRs, then this automation will honor that and enable a GitLab driven issue state, without auto creating issues. We can link your DevRev issue to GitLab activity, through mention of issue-ID in branches, commits, and PRs.

However, if you choose to work in GitLab and never created or linked an issue, you shouldn’t have to sweat it. This automation will automatically create issues that track all associated commits, branches and merge requests. The auto-created issue is enriched with MR description and related GitLab events. The status of these issues is driven by GitLab activity, and the issues will auto-transition stages, from In Development to In Review, and Closed. Your work is always accounted for and more importantly your team members have visibility and know what you’ve been up to, resulting in fewer interruptions.
